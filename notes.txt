It also contains sample.in and sample.out that shows both sample input and ouput for correct inputs (upper and lower case), incorrect input and the program running correctly. The sample outputs and inputs requested show the correct execution of the program.
It uses seed produced by time(0) on the next run to verify the correct output twice.
This program assumes that input to consensus will be of the correct type.

Also included is the Makefile, inspired by the Makefile used in lecture but modified for this particular project.
